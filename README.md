This Repository contains all the assignment codes that I've solved while learning Python from TuteDude

Step 1:Clone the Repository into local first using 
(git clone "https://github.com/AnnadataHemanth/TuteDude.git")

Step 2: Create a virtual environment using (python -m venv .venv) and activate it using  
(.venv\Scripts\activate)



Task 1:
Python Program which takes two inputs from the user and gives Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Operations for those two numbers and prints it for the user.

Task 2: 
Python Program which takes First name and Last name as inputs from the user and concatenates the first and last name into one full name and prints a personalized Greeting Message.

To run the codes use - (python Filename.py)
